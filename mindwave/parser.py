"""

    This interface library is designed to be used from very different contexts.
    The general idea is that the Mindwave modules in the headset (and other devices)
    talk a common binary protocol, which is entirely one-sided from headset to device/
    computer, with one exception (explained later). The means of transport however
    does vary. The original MindWave headset had 2.4Ghz wireless connection, using a
    proprietary USB dongle/receiver. This receiver is mounted as a serial console in
    Linux. It also requires extra commands to connect and disconnect.
    
    The MindWave mobile uses bluetooth, which I would recommend over the 2.4Ghz version.
    
    There have been hacks with arduinos hooked up to the Thinkgear AM modules directly.
    
    Not only are the technical means of data transport different, your application needs
    one of several possible means of regularly reading the data.
    
    In the EuroPython 2014 talk "Brainwaves for Hackers" I demonstrated a way to do this
    in the IPython Notebook, and that only involved a blocking read from a bluetooth socket at
    certain intervals. Pygame works the same way.
    
    There are more sophisticated event loops out there, like in Kivy, Gevent or Tornado.
    
    That are the reasons why there is a parser module that can be fed a stream of bytes.
    You can add recorders to the parser, which take care of analyzing the parsed data.
    
    There is for example one recorder which converts the parsed data into Pandas
    Timeseries. But doing that dozens of times per second is too much work for weak
    processors, like in the Raspberry Pi, so there you would probably derive your own
    parser.
